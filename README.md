# üìà Forecasting Forex Through Machine Learning: An LSTM Model

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to automate Forex trading. We developed an LSTM model to predict market trends and execute buy/sell orders, aiming to minimize risk and simplify trading strategies.

## üìú Project Overview

This project explores the potential of machine learning in Forex trading by:

*   Developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for market prediction.
*   Automating buy/sell orders based on real-time data and model predictions.
*   Integrating the model into MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform using MQL5.
*   Providing backtesting results to demonstrate model performance.

## üåü Key Features

*   **LSTM Model:** Utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory network for effective sequential data analysis.
*   **Real-Time Data:** Fetches real-time market data from MetaTrader 5.
*   **Automated Trading:** Executes buy/sell orders based on the model's predictions.
*   **Integration with MT5:** Deploys the model into the MT5 trading platform.
*   **Backtesting Results:** Demonstrates model performance with backtesting data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Steps

1.  **Understanding Trading Fundamentals:**
    *   The project began by learning basic trading principles through various courses and resources.

2.  **Creating a Machine Learning Model:**
    *   **Data Acquisition:** Real-time data was gathered from MetaTrader 5 using specific commands.
    *   **Data Preprocessing:** Data was cleaned and prepared for model training.
    *   **Model Selection:** The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm was selected as the appropriate model for this sequential data.
    *   **Model Training:** The LSTM model was trained, tested, and optimized to achieve desired results.

3.  **Deployment:**
    *   **MQL5 Integration:** The trained model was integrated into the MetaTrader 5 platform using MQL5.
    *   **Trading Strategy:** A strategy was created to execute buy/sell actions based on the model's predictions.
    *   **Automated Trading Robot:** With one click, the robot can start trading automatically.

## üìä Model Performance

*   **Backtesting Results:** The model was evaluated using backtesting data, and the results are included below.
